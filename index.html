<h1>“Fireflies”</h1>

<p>Like softly floating Christmas lights, fireflies just always add a bit of magic to the forests they live in.</p>

<p>// press &amp; hold to cause some firefly chaos</p>

<p>But there are thousands of different species of firefly, and one in particular has even <em>more</em> magic. In Southeast Asia, if you go out to the riverbank deep in the night, you&#39;ll be treated to this stunning lightshow – courtesy of the male Malaysian firefly:</p>

<p>The entire forest, lighting up all at once, plunging into darkness, then lighting up all again – in perfect synchrony. How do tens of thousands of fireflies coordinate with each other? Who is the conductor of this visual orchestra?</p>

<p>It was a mystery for nearly a century, and in 1992, a team of US scientists set out to solve it. Sadly, but not surprisingly, the press mocked them – <em>“Govt. Blows Your Tax $$ to Study Fireflies in Borneo: Not a Bright Idea!”</em> read one tabloid. Undeterred, the scientists pressed on, cameras and calculators in hand.</p>

<p>So, how <em>do</em> tens of thousands of fireflies pick a leader to follow, a maestro to keep their flashing in time? The answer, the scientists found, is simple:</p>

<p>They don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Each firefly has its <em>own</em> individual internal clock, and every time the clock &quot;strikes twelve&quot;, it flashes. Instead of synchronizing their clocks to a central leader, each firefly does the following:</p>

<p>Step 1: when you see a nearby firefly flash, spring your clock a little forward.</p>

<p>Step 2: that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Can such a small, short-ranged interaction really cause an entire forest full of fireflies to flash in synchronous harmony? Only one way to find out...</p>

<p>Watch carefully.</p>

<p>What do you see?</p>

<p>At first, not much. The fireflies still seem to be flashing without pattern.</p>

<p>But after a few seconds, you may notice small &quot;patches&quot; of fireflies firing together – but these individual &quot;patches&quot; are still out of sync.</p>

<p>After a few more seconds, you&#39;ll start seeing fireflies performing a &quot;wave&quot;, like the excited fans in the stands during a baseball game.</p>

<p>Finally, all but a few fireflies begin to flash in sync – and eventually, even these laggards join in the dance.</p>

<p>What&#39;s even more amazing? Even if you disrupt their collective dance by causing some chaos, yes, it may cause the fireflies to split for a moment, but slowly and surely, they shall collect themselves again, and flash as one.</p>

<p>// point -&gt;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few more buttons &amp; sliders you can use, to play around with these virtual fireflies:</p>

<p><em>That&#39;s</em> the secret behind our fireflies&#39; magic trick:</p>

<p><strong>// small-scale interactions → large-scale organization.</strong></p>

<p>As it turns out, fireflies aren&#39;t the only things that synchronize themselves from the bottom up. Your neurons create brain waves. Your heart&#39;s pacemaker cells fire in sync. Even a bunch of lifeless metronomes on a wobbly platform will start to march together. Understanding self-synchrony has even helped us build better lasers, computers, and communications technology!</p>

<p>The mathematics of self-synchronizing systems was, by the way, discovered in part by a few scientists who just really loved fireflies. Looks like calling their project <em>&quot;Not a Bright Idea&quot;</em> was not a bright idea.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>You float along, softly, in silence, occasionally punctuating the darkness with a flash of bright light. You&#39;re beautiful in your own right, but by yourself, you&#39;re not really that interesting.</p>

<p>But whenever you flash your light, you inspire those close to you to flash too, a little bit sooner than they otherwise would. And those close to you, in turn, inspire those close to <em>them</em>. And so on, and so on.</p>

<p>For a long time, nothing seems to happen. But then, a few small groups start flashing together. And then, a wave of light sweeps across the swarm. And finally, you&#39;re all dazzling together, a brilliant beacon, all in harmony, in tandem – in synchrony.</p>

<p>What small-scale interaction will you make today, little firefly?</p>
